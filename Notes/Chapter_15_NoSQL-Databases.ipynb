To run the store, information about both mobile phones (e.g., model names and prices) and groceries (e.g prices and descriptions) need to be stored. In the future, the store may also start selling mobile phone subscription plans as well. Storing all this data in the same relational database may not be easy. In this case, non-relational databases, also referred to as NoSQL databases, can offera better choice.\n",

    "- document databases. Document databases work like a hash table, but each key can point to an embedded key-value structure, also known as a **document**, instead of just a single value. (Recall that in a hash table, each key points to a single value or data item.). E.g., MongoDB\n",

    "- Relational databases represent data in tables and rows while document databases store  data as collections of documents.\n",

    "# 15.6 Advantages of NoSQL Databases over Relational Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relational databases have a predefined schema that is difficult to change. Even if you wish to add a field to a small number of records, you still need to include the field for the entire table. Therefore, it can be difficult to support the processing of unstructured data using relational databases compared to NoSQL databases.\n",
    "- Unlike NoSQL databases, relational databases do not usually support hierarchical data storage, where less frequently-used data is moved to cheaper, slower storage devices. This means that the cost of storing data in a relational database is more expensive than storing the same amount of data in a NoSQL database.\n",
    "- Relational databases are mainly vertically scalable while NoSQL databases are mainly horizontally scalable. Vertically scalable means that improving the performance of a relational database server usually requires upgrading an existing server with faster processors and more memory. Such high-performance components can be expensive and upgrades are limited by the capacity of a single machine. On the other hand, horizontally scalable means that the performance of a NoSQL database can be improved by simply increasing the number of servers. This is relatively cheaper as mass-produced average-performance computers are easily available at low prices.\n",
    "- Relational databases are stored in a server, which makes the database unavailable when the server fails. NoSQL databases are designed to take advantage of multiple servers so that if one server fails, the other servers can continue to support applications."
